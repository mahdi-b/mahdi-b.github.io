###  High School Interns Develop ChatGPT-Powered Electronic Medical Record System Prototype

There’s a lot of excitement around AI these days, and for good reason – it’s transforming industries and reshaping the way we live and work. Every year, as part of the Hokulani Project, our lab hosts interns who learn about AI and take on exciting and innovative AI projects. This internship is not just about coding or algorithms; it’s about teaching the students to innovate, and push the boundaries of what’s possible with AI.

Last year, interns built Resheipt ([https://www.hawaii.edu/news/2023/09/12/project-hokulani-resheipt-app/]()). This summer, our latest cohort of interns developed an application called Parrot Forms, designed to assist doctors by automating the charting process.

Here’s a quick overview: the application listens to post-appointment conversations between doctors and patients, transcribes them, and extracts key information such as chief complaints and symptoms. Using the Subjective-Objective Assessment Plan (SOAP) method, the app then enters this information into a mock electronic medical record application that the interns built from scratch, effectively acting as a digital assistant.

Even without specialized software, these interns developed a tool that not only transcribes but also comprehends and organizes medical information, simplifying documentation for doctors. It’s more than just a scribe – it’s a comprehensive digital helper. The students, who hail from eight high schools in Hawaii, were able to build these tools by harnessing generative AI in various aspects, from learning and disambiguating medical concepts to problem-solving, design, and scripting a prototype.

Our experience with the Hokulani Project and the incredible work our interns have done over the past three years is a testament to the real potential of AI. Beyond the entertainment aspect, AI is a powerful tool that, when harnessed correctly, can solve real-world problems and create innovative solutions. The projects our interns have completed not only highlight their talent and dedication but also underscore the profound impact AI can have when developed and guided thoughtfully.

With tools like generative AI and sophisticated frameworks, the barrier to entry for developing robust applications has significantly lowered. This advancement promises fewer bugs, more secure systems, and cost-effective solutions. By creating Parrot Forms, our interns demonstrated that AI could effectively address critical needs in healthcare. As generative AI technologies continue to evolve and become more integrated into educational and professional settings, we believe the future of software development will be brighter, more reliable, and increasingly innovative.
