I am an Assistant Research Professor at the University of Hawaii Manoa, with appointments in Information & Computer Sciences and the Hawaii 
Institute of Marine Biology. I previously served as the Associate Director of the Hawaii Data Science Institute and as Director of the UH Bioinformatics Core.  My work focuses primarily on modeling biological big data, with an emphasis on machine learning (language models) and probabilistic algorithms. 
In addition to bioinformatics, I am also interested in data science education and integrating AI models to facilitate collaborative research, decision making and document analytics.
