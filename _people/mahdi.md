I am an Associate Research Professor and Associate Chair of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa, with research appointment in the Hawai‘i Institute of Marine Biology.

Previously, I served as the Associate Director of the Hawai‘i Data Science Institute and Director of the UH Bioinformatics Core. My research focuses on modeling biological big data, particularly through machine learning (language models) and probabilistic algorithms.

Beyond bioinformatics, I have a strong interest in data science education and the integration of AI models to enhance collaborative research, decision-making, and document analytics.
