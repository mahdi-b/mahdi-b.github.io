### Who We Are and What We Do
We are a multidisciplinary research lab at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. 
We are part of the [Information and Computer Sciences Department](https://ics.hawaii.edu), the Hawaii 
[Institute of Marine Biology]() and the [Hawaii Data Science Institute](). 
Our research centers around the utilization of informatics, including the emerging area 
of large-scale language models,  with a specific emphasis on their relevance and 
potential in the field of biology and document analytics.
###### **Mission Statement**
<strong>Our aim</strong> is to drive scientific innovation by creating innovative methods and technologies 
in computational biology, natural language processing, and scientific software engineering. 
<strong>We prioritize</strong> core values such as collaboration, respect, and excellence. 
Through our work, <strong>we endeavor </strong>to make a positive impact on Hawaii and the world.
