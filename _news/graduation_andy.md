Recently, Andy successfully defended his master's thesis and also accepted a role as a Research Programmer at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.

### Master’s Thesis Defense

In his master's thesis, "Improving Efficiency in Data Wrangling with Semantic Type Detection", Andy introduces 'SLED' (Semantic LLM Enrichment of Data), a Python library that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate key aspects of data wrangling. SLED is designed to align with FAIR data principles, focusing on enhancing data through contextualization, documentation, and validation. This development represents a meaningful step forward in simplifying data management and FAIR adherence processes.

### New Role at University of Hawaii at Manoa

Andy's journey continues at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where he will join as a Research Programmer in cyberinfrastructure. His role will involve developing tools and infrastructure to support research and scientific studies at the university and beyond. Andy's expertise, particularly in the area of LLMs and AI, will undoubtedly be crucial in advancing the university’s research capabilities.

Congratulations, Andy!
