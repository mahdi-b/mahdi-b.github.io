Excited to share that Michael has successfully defended his Master's Thesis, marking a major step in his academic journey. His thesis focuses on the architecture of a scalable framework that "integrates data science and artificial intelligence into SAGE3 ... to foster an environment conducive to intricate, data-driven collaboration."

Transitioning to computer Science from a background in linguistics and intelligence within the US Air Force and subsequently in the national security sector, Michael has demonstrated exceptional adaptability and dedication to his new career in computer science. Over the past two and a half years, Michael has evolved into a mature and skilled software engineer. His work incorporating data science into SAGE 3 lays a foundation that will undoubtedly leave a lasting impact on the SAGE3 capabilities and future developments.

Congratulations, Michael, on your well-earned accomplishment!
