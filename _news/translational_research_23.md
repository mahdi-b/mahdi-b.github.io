### Reflecting on the Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment Team’s 20-Year Translational Research Endeavor in Digital Collaboration Tools.

I am happy to announce the publication of our latest study, "Reflecting on the Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment Team’s 20-Year Translational Research Endeavor in Digital Collaboration Tools," in Computing in Science & Engineering.

This paper encapsulates reflections on and an in-depth analysis of our extensive research in translational software, encompassing projects such as SAGE3, along with tools and pipelines for computational biology research. It highlights the pivotal factors that, in our experience, paved the way for our team's successes in translational software. Furthermore, the article is intended to serve as a platform for dialogue, aiming to stimulate further discourse and foster the development of effective and innovative models for future translational software projects.
